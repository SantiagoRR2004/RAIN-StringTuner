## Project Summary

For this project we had to choose between three types of projects: a diagnosis system (Bayesian Networks), a control system (Fuzzy Logic) or a recommender system. There were multiple topics for each type of project, and we chose the topic of "Fuzzy Control to tune a String Instrument". Run main.py to see a entire instrument be tuned. If you want to tune a string in the real world use the file interaction.py and follow the instructions. Remember that the turn that is output is the turn made after turning the peg. It does not take into account the gear ratio of the pegs.
